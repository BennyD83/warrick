I took a trip to my hometown in NJ this month (August 2002).  While I was  there, I  wanted to pay my respects to the thousands of victims who lost their lives at the World Trade Center.  Since I was not able to make it into NYC to Ground Zero, we went to the waterfront in Jersey City (Exchange Place)...a place I had been so many times before..where the skyline seems so close you could reach out and touch it. <br> 
<br>
I stood on the pier and looked into the darkness of that empty sky in disbelief.  Seeing the events of that day unfold in the news coverage did not prepare me for seeing this in person.  There was such an erie calm along the waterfront that evening...the water was quiet and the small chatter between people seemed whispered... there were no words at the time to describe what I felt. <br>
<br>
The waterfront was filled with many people...people who were there for maybe the same reason I was...some had cameras, some were silent, others (like me) just stared.  One moment stands out in my mind and brought me to tears....there were about 5 PSE&G (electric company) workers who were either working on something at the waterfront, or had just gathered there.  A few moments later, they all stood side by side, facing the skyline, staring  in silence.  After a minute or two they disassembled and went about their business as usual.  Chills ran through my body, tears filled my eyes and I was overwelmed with emotion... I was proud to have witnessed such a moment...we truly will never forget! <br></div><br>
