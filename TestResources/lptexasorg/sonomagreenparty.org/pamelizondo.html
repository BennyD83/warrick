				<h2>Pamela Elizondo - Vote for Pam in November!</h2>
				
				<ul>
				<h3>Pam's Events</h3>
				<p>Look for my poster at the green booth at FREEDOM DANCE July 17/06 11-4 recreational grove E. Commercial, Willits, CA and at Sierra Nevada World Music Festival Boonville Fairgrounds Highway 128 W.</p>
<p>I'm going to be at Bohemia Grove, Monte Rio July 21 and 22, with music groups Johnny Jukebox, Freesound.</p></ul>
					<ul>
						<h3>Statement of Purpose</h3>
<P>I'm the only politician that offers solutions. MARIJUANA FARMS NOT ARMS FOR GASOLINE and all its other uses, stopping global warming and the need for war. I offer 5 simple changes to save the Earth and its inhabitants that can be applied to all issues listed below.</P>
						<OL>
							<LI>For increased tax base charge ONE CENT tax Federal, State, and County every dollar transaction rather then current way.</LI>
							<LI>Governments should BUY what they want through private business rather then spend trillions of taxpayer's war dollars STEALING it.</LI>
							<LI>Taxpayer's dollars now wasted on taxpayer's NON-PROFIT ORGANIZATIONS [defense space research, charity to other countries, unneeded building: skyscrapers, sport arenas, convention centers, governor's mansions], should be diverted to 2 year 
grants employing people researching and restoring OUR Earth.</LI>
							<LI>Businesses and Landowner's should get tax exemptions and deductions only for money spent employing and benefitting people restoring OUR Earth.</LI>
							<LI>Legalize hemp and marijuana, PROFIT from growing everywhere as substitute for current source of paper, fossil fuel products, hydro and nuclear energy, parents for baby trees, dirty air, food, water, a failing economy and environment.</LI>
						</OL><br><IMG src="pages/hotstuff/images/pams1.jpg" alt="" width="300" height="275" border="0">
<h4>Issues:</h4>
						<OL>
							<LI>Logging cannot remain a viable source of income, employment, 
environmental security as OUR trees are vanishing and being butchered in other countries. I suggest 
we start paying grants, tax deductions and exemptions creating businesses here only to 
restore OUR Earth.</LI>
							<LI>Corporate owned media brainwashes people to believe only what the 
government wants, mostly that we can't be successful if we don't buy all the stuff they 
profit from selling us, they create apathetic populace who think their input is unimportant so 
they don't vote or expect any returns for their tax dollars. This applies to most political 
parties and environmental groups who concentrate on not losing personal power rather then using 
their power and new ideas to effect change.</LI>
							<LI>Governments should forego treaties and buy what they want through private business. If big business moves out of country let them sell their goods to their chosen country or charge huge taxes and tariffs to peddle here.</LI>
							<LI>Our government should use OUR tax dollars to crate business employment, organic medical care here restoring OUR Earth.</LI>
							<LI>We should divert taxpayer's dollars now wasted on taxpayer's NON-PROFIT ORGANIZATIONS[ defense, space research, etc.] to 2 year grants spent only on employment researching and restoring OUR Earth, providing alternate sources of hydro and nuclear power, stopping Global warming and the need for war.</LI>
							<LI>Hospitals and health care facilities should get grants, tax deductions, and exemptions only for creation of biodegradable organic treatments, home care, natural child birthing, and more employment so health workers don't have to work so hard under stress. OUR government owes us employment with good wages and benefits rather then defense space research, world dominion, and destruction.</LI>
							<LI>We need to convince government and big business they can PROFIT more from mass employment growing hemp and marijuana everywhere if just for gasoline, stopping global warming, the need for war, lies, Earthly destruction centered around world 
dominion.</LI>
							<LI>Every country should be represented with equal input, all policies should be enacted only for restoration of Earth.</LI>
							<LI>All nuclear weapons should be dismantled to use for safe energy with UN supervision.</LI>
							<LI>The Patriot act is just another way to attack the taxpayers, garnering huge profit for protective services, judges, jails prisons, supporting all their belongings, sucking the money  remaining after taxes from the people in mostly unconstitutional fines, destroying our lives and  economy. Drug use, seat belts, children's car seats, what kind of education, life and future of our Children, helmets, etc. are PRO-CHOICE issues our government enacts laws to control and profit from the misery of the populace. All public representatives should be recalled, possibly jailed for not fighting for the constitutional rights of all their constituents, the Earth.</LI>
							<LI>Restoring Earth with taxpayer's dollars encourages us to become more one with nature as our financial survival will depend on us knowing how to succeed, as will big business. It builds a sustainable economy as we'll never have enough hemp and marijuana to replace all its substitutes. Paid $15 an hour, 30 hour workweek, $300 monthly living stipend = $27,000 yearly, less then jail or prison, creating taxpaying consumers. TRUE CAPITALISM. Sociologically , people reproduce less when financially and medically secure, creating less population stressing the Earth and cities. We can put our governmentally programed competitiveness into effect playing off who creates the most friendly environment: cities or country folk.</LI>
							<LI>If all laws center around saving OUR Earth the question of where they originate is moot. The tax of ONE CENT Federal, State, County every dollar transaction will supply enough money to supply all needs, everyone paying their fair share. The best 
insights to learn from American traditions I've observed is that killing people, destroying Earth worldwide and establishing big business elsewhere with taxpayer's dollars is not capitalistically successful. As an international political party I believe 
we need to redirect their knowledge to true profit, NON VIOLENT REVOLUTION.</LI>
						</OL>
<h4>Grassroots solutions</h4>
<P>I fantasize turning Hartsook Inn and other empty buildings, skyscrapers into living spaces housing people, healing families creating businesses restoring OUR Earth. We'd have people soliciting grants, land for growth, supersoil sources, digging, planting, creating natural toileting facilities, researching uses for hemp and marijuana including nonviolent housing, and saving OUR wildlife. OUR judges and protective services could PROFIT greatly from marketing our now illegal product since they know where we are instead of from people's misery as they are now.</P><IMG src="pages/hotstuff/images/pams2.jpg" width="300" height="294" alt="">
<P>DEMOCRATIC POLITICAL FINANCIAL REFORM</P>
						<OL>
							<LI>Stop political profiteering and commensurate fund matching.</LI>
							<LI>Stop party politics, elect representatives for IDEAL, not LABEL.</LI>
							<LI>Stop electoral colleges, political conventions, let the people's vote count.</LI>
							<LI>Representatives should be allowed to carry on their own businesses and meet only time necessary to make sure TAXPAYER'S dollars are spent only on restoration of Earth, with commensurate salaries for less time spent.</LI>
							<LI>Change all terms to 6 years to cut campaign costs and confusion.</LI>
							<LI>Every candidate should get equal media time within their district and point of view aired equally everywhere.</LI>
							<LI>We should have no cost ballot access and ballot statement. One beneficial idea to save the Earth should be all needed to achieve ballot status.</LI>
							<LI>My ballot designation, ENVIRONMENTAL HEALING ADVOCATE, that which attracts like thinking voters to vote for me is my constitutional right to free speech, my decision not the Secretary of States.</LI>
