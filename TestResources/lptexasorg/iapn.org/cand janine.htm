<p><strong>REASON FOR SEEKING THIS ELECTED PUBLIC OFFICE</strong></p>

<p>I have dedicated my life to protecting our God-given Constitutionally protected
liberties. I believe in government of, by and for the people. I first ran for Congress
when I was 25 years old. I am pro-life and pro-family. </p>

<p>I believe in the unabridged right to keep and bear arms. I support abolishing the IRS,
reducing wasteful government spending and lowering taxes by limiting the Federal
government to those powers specified in the U.S. Constitution. The federal government
should not control 89% of Nevada&#146;s land. </p>

<p>I support protecting American jobs and oppose international trade agreements, which
send our jobs </p>

<p>over seas. I am for protecting our borders and against amnesty for illegal immigrants.
I am for defending America, but oppose undeclared wars and UN &quot;peacekeeping&quot;
wars. </p>

<p>I worked for passage of AJR 9 to protect the liberty and privacy of citizens from
government abuses of the social security number.</p>
