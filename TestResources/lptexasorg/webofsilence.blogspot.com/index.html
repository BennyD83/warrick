<b> Oh, what joy this gives me. I remember his original post where he announced his decision to join the Mac bores after he'd spent all day trying to install Windows XP. Funny I managed to do it in 53 minutes on a 3 year old machine. </b> <i>Mac attack: Okay, so my beloved Powerbook crashed for the second time today. After backing up all my files, I took it down to the Apple store in Soho, New York City. Actually, "store" doesn't capture what that place is like. It's a church. The clean, spare lines, the vaulted glass ceiling, the large posters of Martin Luther King Jr and John Lennon, the illuminated perspex stairs that ascend toward the tabernacle ... and the reverent hush of the trendoids who bustle there. I almost found myself reflexively genuflecting. I took my frayed laptop - not even a year old - to the "Genius" desk and had a very helpful guy review my case. It's hopeless. The hard drive seems completely screwed and it has to be replaced entirely. It makes strange whirring and clicking sounds all the time. I won't see it again for ten days. There's nothing I can do in the meantime but use my friends' computers to update the Dish and do all the work I usually do on a Thursday, my busiest day of the week, on the hotel p.c. Am I complaining as a relatively public switcher from p.c.s to a Mac? Not entirely. I'm sure all sorts of computers break down like this (although I never had a p.c. that did). Maybe it was the dank air in Provincetown that did it in; or my ceaseless use of iTunes. But it's a little embarrassing for Apple to have such a high-profile "switch" ad campaign going on and have one of their most enthusiastic switchers see his computer collapse from mechanical problems within a few months. </i> <b><a href="http://www.andrewsullivan.com">More</a>.</b><br>

<b>A very strange man is my friend Mr X/And none too fond of the opposite sex.</b> <i>Yet, at the beginning of the new century, he is an indispensable poet. Even people who don't read poems often turn to poetry at moments when it matters, and Auden matters now. In the eighties, his lyric "Stop All the Clocks" became the elegy of the AIDS era, sold on bookstore counters, by the registers. In the nineties, Robert Hughes led off his memorable polemic against postmodernism "The Culture of Complaint" with a long, marvelling quote from Auden's Christmas oratorio, "For the Time Being," where the liberal King Herod mourns the loss of rational consensus in the face of feckless sectarianism. In the past year, Auden has been everywhere, by the sheer force of popular will. Two of his lyrics about suffering and confusion—"Musée des Beaux Arts" and "September 1, 1939"—sprang to renewed life after last September 11th as the embodiments of our mood, posted on Web sites and subway walls. Even fashion models, and not just fashion models, now name their sons Auden, as they might ten years ago have called them Dylan, and pose with them on the cover of Vogue.</i> <a href="http://www.newyorker.com/printable/?critics/020923crat_atlarge"><b>More.</b></a> <br>

<b>My back's gone again. Second time this year. All I did was bend down to tie my shoelaces and yikes!

There may be less poetry in Laurel and Hardy, but there are bigger laughs; Stan's absurdity and his sleepiness, his tears and stubbornness, seem to sit so perfectly with Ollie's plausible rotundness, his irritation, ambition and wide-eyed panic.

<b>God gets spammed.</b><i> A 650-year-old Scottish church has embraced technology by offering an online prayer service around the world. <br>Supplicants can send an email with their request and, once a day, priests at Rosslyn Chapel, a 15th century foundation outside Edinburgh, print off the messages and offer them up to God. The chapel has had requests from as far afield as the US during its inaugural run. <br>The requests are kept confidential, but they have included intercession for success in exams, personal relationships, job interviews, and crises of faith. <br>The chapel is best known for legends involving Knights Templar and Freemasons - and recently was depicted by the crime novelist Ian Rankin as the hiding place for a clue in his book The Falls. <br>It is thought to be the first church in Scotland to have an e-prayer facility; The Rev Michael Fass, the priest in charge, said: "These e-prayers are allowing us to build a long-distance worshipping community. We live increasingly disconnected lives. If this is the way we can connect people to the church, then it must be a good idea." <br>Andrew Heavens, the Scottish Episcopal church's spokesman, said: "There have been some very heart-wrenching and personal requests.

<b> I bought another bag today. I don't know why. It's not as if I ever go any where. I just like collecting luggage, I suppose. I must have between twenty and thirty now. Everything from rucksacks to an old sea dog's trunk. It seems I have a permanent fantasy about just taking off for somewhere distant and want to be prepared. Strange really, beause one of my earliest childhood memories is of suffering a massive panic attack at the railway station as we were waiting for a train to take us on holiday. I must have been about tenish and I suddenly became so spooked by the thought of being taken away from my familiar surroundings and having to adjust to somewhere strange and alien that I ran all the way home and adamantly reused to shift.  Although I'd already seen an educational pyschologist I hadn't been diagnosed or anything and yet my family already knew better than to argue with me,  so I was left home alone for two weeks with an uncle to look in on me occasionally  while they caught a later train. I still remember this as a happy time. </b><br><i>This web page is designed to give everyone an idea of what our universe actually looks like.

<b> As a necesarry corrective to all these cutesy kids <a href="http://freespace.virgin.net/david.mied/index.htm">here</a> is a truly depressing site by a forty year old mindblind/autistic poet from Rotheram in England. His parents have both died leaving him desperate to find the wife he thinks will assuage his loneliness. It never occurs to him to ask himself why any woman would want to marry him or what he might do to attract one. He simply assumes that if he talks incessantly of his loneliness in poem after poem then one will just present herself at his door.<br>He reminded me of the boy I read about who having finally found himself a girlfriend, then  lost her, simply attached himself to another girl, doing and saying to her everything he had done and said to the other one.

 <b>Ordinarily I give a wide berth to the myriad of sites with pictures of cute autistic kids. This one, though, is in a class of it's own. The Autism Picture Page was put together by the Austrailian autistic educator Lindsay Weekes but is now administered by an <a href="http://psy-138-006.bsd.uchicago.edu/~autpics/front.html">American dwarf </a>(yes, really). It has an extensive and rather revealing autobiography by Weekes as well as 138 pictures of kids he has helped over the years. Each picture shows kids caught displaying a characteristic autistic trait together with a few lines of interpretation by Weekes underneath.<br>     For example under 'Absorbtion' there's a picture of Anthony touching a tree and looking up at it with rapture and awe.</b> <i>Autistic people become totally absorbed in the beauty of objects we often find irritating or meaningless.</i><br>     <b>Underneath two kids are lining up their toy cars.</b> <i>It's a natural part of the human condition to want to bring order to chaos, and it's a lot more comfortable for autistic people when order and often a strict routine are in place. In the pictures above and below, Jack Borland and Alex Bain are absorbed in and demonstrating a well-known autistic behaviour, that is, lining objects up in a precise millimetric order, just so.</i><br>     <b> In the section entitled 'Affection' (not, you might think, the most extensive part of a website dealing with autistic people.) Anthony re-appears this time giving his friend Shaun a big kiss. </b> <i>Autistic people demonstrate affection in both standard and non-standard ways. Some only demonstrate affection at certain specific times, or in certain places. Shaun enjoys an affectionate relationship with Ben, his older (non-autistic) brother, as well as with Anthony, an autistic schoolmate. These boys have become very dependent on each other in the classroom, although it's going to far to call them friends.</i><br>       That last sentence will dispell any illusions.<br>

<b>My speech came late and what there was of it was both formal and pedantic. I've never really spoken to anyone outside my immediate family and the last of them to speak to me was in the winter of 93. So I've been entirely mute now for 9 1/2 years. I can ask for stuff in shops. I've been able to do that for years. As long as the 'chat' consentrates on something concrete like the price of paint, then I know what the bounderies are and can anticipate any eventuality; so I'm in command, a sense of calm prevails.

A MORE DOWN-TO-EARTH DESCRIPION BY LOIS FRIESLEBEN-COOK.<br>
NOTE:(This was originally a post to the bit.listserv.autism newsgroup/listserv)<br> 
I saw that someone posted the DSM IV criteria for Asperger's but I thought it might be good to provide a more down to earth description. Asperger's Syndrome is a term used when a child or adult has some features of autism but may not have the full blown clinical picture. There is some disagreement about where it fits in the PDD spectrum. A few people with Asperger's syndrome are very successful and until recently were not diagnosed with anything but were seen as brilliant, eccentric, absent minded, socially inept, and a little awkward physically. 

Although the criteria state no significant delay in the development of language milestones, what you might see is a "different" way of using language. A child may have a wonderful vocabulary and even demonstrate hyperlexia but not truly understand the nuances of language and have difficulty with language pragmatics. Social pragmatics also tend be weak, leading the person to appear to be walking to the beat of a "different drum". Motor dyspraxia can be reflected in a tendency to be clumsy. 

In social interaction, many people with Asperger's syndrome demonstrate gaze avoidance and may actually turn away at the same moment as greeting another. The children I have known do desire interaction with others but have trouble knowing how to make it work. They are, however, able to learn social skills much like you or I would learn to play the piano. 

There is a general impression that Asperger's syndrome carries with it superior intelligence and a tendency to become very interested in and preoccupied with a particular subject. Often this preoccupation leads to a specific career at which the adult is very successful. At younger ages, one might see the child being a bit more rigid and apprehensive about changes or about adhering to routines. This can lead to a consideration of OCD but it is not the same phenomenon. 

Many of the weaknesses can be remediated with specific types of therapy aimed at teaching social and pragmatic skills. Anxiety leading to significant rigidity can be also treated medically. Although it is harder, adults with Asperger's can have relationships, families, happy and productive lives.
