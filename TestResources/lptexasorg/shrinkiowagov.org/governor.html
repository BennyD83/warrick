Shrink Iowa's Government - Litten for Governor</center>
</h1>


<h2>We need to shrink Iowa's Government because,<br>

each new government program:
<img src="lpsign.gif" align="right">
<ul>
  <li>is subject to politics
  </li>
  <li>suffers from poor or indifferent administration
  </li>
  <li>ends up costing more than originally planned
  </li>
  <li>fails to work any better than the last one
  </li>
  <li>has unintended negative consequences
  </li>
  <li>will ultimately be misused</li>
</ul>
</h2>


<blockquote>
  <p>"There are those who will tell you not to vote for a third party
candidate because his chances of winning are small. Yet if you keep 
voting for Democrats and Republicans, you will
continue to get more of the government you have been getting. The
only way to get less government intrusion into your life is to change
the way you vote. I may not win this election, but every vote cast for
me, the Libertarian candidate, will be a vote for the principles of
personal liberty and fiscal responsibility. The D's and R's won't stop
stiffing you until you vote against them. Let your vote count as a
protest against increased government spending and for personal liberty."</p>


  <p>"Work hard, take responsibility for yourself, and mind your own 
business." If you believe that, perhaps you are a libertarian and just
don't know it yet."</p>


  <p>Please vote for me this November. Thank you.<br>
 
                            -  <b>Kevin Litten</b></p>

<h3>
<center>Other issues</center>
</h3>
 
<ul>
  <li>Iowa citizens should be able to propose ballot initiatives. Our 
constitution gives us this right,why can't we do it?
  </li>
  <li>I support an individuals right to protect themself, the Castle Doctrine, and "Shall Issue"
policies such as those proposed by<a href="http://www.iowacarry.org/"><b> www.iowacarry.org</b></a>
  </li>
  <li>12 States have no property tax, shouldn't Iowa be the 13th?
  </li>
  <li>I support open debates between all candidates - not these phony forums sponsored by special interests
and biased media. Having only two parties offers Iowa the same choice, which is no choice.
  </li>
  <li>Iowa's charter school law essentially bans charter schools, it needs to be changed. Our students need choices, not restrictions.
  </li>
  <li>There must be transparency in government. With the internet there is no excuse for not publishing where all our money goes.
  </li>
  <li>There must be a hard copy for all votes cast. Touch screen voting can be hacked and will be faked. It is too easy to abuse.</li>
</ul>

 votes decide everything."<br>

<p>I hope you will support me in my campaign to become Iowa's next
governor. If you believe in the principles of reduced state spending as
the best way to preserve our freedoms then you know that freedom is not 
free, it must be bought with your time, money, and sacrifice.
Chump change, compared to what our founding fathers paid. Please give
generously. At the very minimum, please vote for me and tell your 
friends to do the same.</p>


Yes, I'd like to help Kevin Litten shrink Iowa's Government with my 
contribution of $_________________*<br>

*Federal Law requires that all gifts of $200 or more must be reported.
Just another way our federal government stifles your free speech.
