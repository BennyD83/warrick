Our culture experienced a massive shock on September 11th.  Days later,
still struggling to grasp the immensity of the death and destruction
caused by the attacks, I began to wonder how much space would be filled
if each victim were represented by a one inch square.  I then invited
other people to join me in creating a visual depiction of this basic
concept.
<P>
One Inch: One Person is a unique collage that seeks to represent the
number of lives lost in the September 11th attacks, currently believed
to be about 3,000. Although the number still seems too vast and too
abstract to truly comprehend, it is my hope that once completed, this
piece will aid in understanding, and act as both memorial and guide.
 <P>
People are invited to join in this collaborative project by submitting
artwork of their own.  One Inch: One Person, now nearly halfway
completed, will be displayed with an outline showing the space yet to be
filled.<P>
<b>Guidelines</b>

<ul>
<li>Participants are asked to submit a 5" x 5" piece that has been
segmented into a grid of 1" x 1" squares.  Each 1" square should hold an
image of a human face or form.  It is important that these images be
recognizable as people/human but not as specific individuals (e.g. not
straight on, full-face photographs).
 
<li>It is fine to submit a grid of any size, as long as it is composed of
1" x 1" squares.  Multiple submissions are also welcome.
 
<li>Collaboration is welcome.
 
<li>Submitted artwork becomes a permanent part of the project unless
provisions are made beforehand.  We will attempt to maintain the
integrity of submitted artwork; however, artwork may be trimmed and
mounted during installation.  If any further alterations are needed,
artists will be contacted and consulted.
</ul>
A phone call or email to let me know of your intention to participate
would be appreciated.
<P>
Please contact me with questions.
